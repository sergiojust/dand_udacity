    "I chose four kinds of plots: **histogram, bar plot, box plot **and** scatter plot**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **histogram** helps me to present the sample distribution of the variables quality and alcohol for red and white wine which, in this case are normal and right-skewed respectively. Then I used a **bar plot** in order to differentiate the categorical variable quality levels with three groups \"deficient\", \"average\" and \"excellent\". Third, I used boxplots to compare the quality of red and white wine versus the levels of alcohol and acetic acid. Both type of wine, had a similar behaviour and the mean and the interquartile distance show that the variation on alcohol and acid affects the quality level. Finally, I chose a **scatter plot** once I knew the relationship between taste and alcohol and acid. Thus, the plot shows that observations are moving to the bottom-right corner when the quality level increases."
